# Once CSS framework

Once CSS framework solves the headache of repetitive CSS. We have adopted best practices from OOCSS and Atomic CSS. The goal is to write the basic widely used classes once and not repeat yourself (DRY).

___Note!___ Project is still under heavy development, we don't recommend using it in production yet!

## Modularization

After the initial heavy development mode, we are planning to modularize project to small modules - so that you can pick only what you need (e.g. typography, grid, spacers...)

## Preprocessors

Currently we're supporting SASS, but plan is to support LESS also.
